# Notes: Building an OpenGraph image generation API with Cloudinary, Netlify Functions, and React

Notes for [Chris Biscardi](https://egghead.io/instructors/chris-biscardi)'s playlist, Building an OpenGraph image generation API with Cloudinary, Netlify Functions, and React on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/building-angular-2-components).

## Description

OpenGraph images are the images you see when you paste a link into a social platform and it "unfurls" into an image, title, and description. This happens on Twitter, Discord, Slack, and many other platforms. This collection goes over everything from designing OpenGraph images in Figma, to implementing them in CodeSandbox, to returning headless browser screenshots from Netlify Functions, and finally using Cloudinary as a write-through cache.

You will come away from this collection with the ability to ship an API that you can use on any of your sites, and also on-demand, that can generate images for not only OpenGraph unfurls, but also for Instagram, GitHub, and more. Using headless browsers with playwright to generate our images means we get full access to all the responsive power of CSS and all the logical power of JS to handle layout, importing assets like pngs, choosing different fonts, and more.
